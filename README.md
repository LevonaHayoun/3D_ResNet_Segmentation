# Automated Detection andSegmentation of Oral Tumors using 3D SegResNet 

## Overview
This project focuses on the automated detection and segmentation of oral tumors in 3D images using MONAI's SegResNet. 

#### The goal is to create a model capable of accurately identifying and segmenting tumor regions in medical images, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Relevant Medical Explanations
The primary medical challenge is the low awareness and infrequency of screenings for oral cancer, which often results in late detection when the disease is less treatable. Dental imaging, routinely performed before procedures like implants or extractions, often captures early signs of oral tumors. However, these signs are frequently overlooked due to the lack of focused attention on non-targeted areas in the scans. This oversight can lead to missed early diagnosis opportunities, significantly affecting patient outcomes.


Using the developed system we are capable of detecting tumors at various stages and providing immediate alerts, regardless of lesion size, location, image resolution, or device type. When a tumor is detected, it is highlighted and flagged for further examination.

#### This system could save lives by drawing attention to potentially overlooked abnormal areas in scanned images.

## Data Preparation
### 1. Convert DICOM to NIfTI: 
The DICOM series of images are converted to NIfTI format after correcting spatial orientation.
### 2. Image Resizing and Stretching:
Images and labels were resized, and the images were also stretched to ensure uniformity in the dataset.
### 3. Visualization:
Tumor regions are visualized to confirm the correctness of the data preparation.

## Data Division
The data used in this project was divided into a training set and a testing set in a 80:20 ratio.

## Model Performance
The model achieved a mean dice of 85% on test samples. Hopefully, with an expended dataset and optimizimg model features we will get better performances.

## Conclusions
This project successfully identifies abnormal tumor regions. By leveraging MONAIâ€™s SegResNet, we achieved accurate segmentation results, as demonstrated by the high Dice coefficient scores and the genrated label for given image. (As shown in the 'Check_model' notebook)
