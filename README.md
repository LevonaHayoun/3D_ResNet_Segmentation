Description: BigTransfer (BiT) State-of-the-art transfer learning for image classification.

## Overview
This project focuses on the automated detection and segmentation of oral tumors in 3D images using MONAI's SegResNet. 

###The goal is to create a model capable of accurately identifying and segmenting tumor regions in medical images, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning

### Project Objective
The main objective was to create a medical aid tool that assists in preventive medicine by analyzing patient data and identifying potential risks for heart disease. Based on features such as age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, our system can offer personalized recommendations and alert for high risks.

### Relevant Medical Explanations
Heart diseases are one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, often resulting from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Early identification of heart disease risks can improve quality of life and reduce mortality. Machine learning models can detect complex patterns in medical data and support medical decision-making.

## Data Division
The data used in this project included [description of the data, e.g., data from over 10,000 patients with features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.]. The data was divided into a training set and a testing set in a 70:30 ratio, where the training set was used to train the model and the testing set was used to evaluate its performance.

### Model Performance
After training the model, performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, recall, and precision. The model achieved an accuracy of X%, a recall of Y%, and a precision of Z%, indicating good capability in identifying heart disease risks.

## Special Steps in the Code
The project involved the use of advanced techniques like [e.g., hyperparameter optimization using Grid Search] to improve the modelâ€™s performance. Additionally, we employed [e.g., dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA] to enhance computational efficiency and reduce noise in the data.

## Conclusions
The project demonstrated the significant potential of using machine learning models for the early detection of heart disease. The model's results show good capability, though there is room for improvement by expanding the dataset and adding additional parameters.
